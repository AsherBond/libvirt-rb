# Libvirt Ruby Library Exmaples

These examples are meant to be run within the source tree of
libvirt, meaning you can run the without installing the libvirt
gem beforehand. To try them out, first install the dependencies
locally using `bundle install`, then run the examples directly
via `ruby`. Example:

    ruby print_domain_info.rb
